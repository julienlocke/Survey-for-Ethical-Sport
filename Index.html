	<h1>2016 Survey for Ethical Sport - Results</h1>
	<p>Thank you for taking time to complete this survey. We will be forwarding the results to as many “agencies” as we can. We believe that people in clubs, in teams, and citizens need to have a chance to express their opinions. If we want our sports to survive, it is important to be heard.</p>

<p>Here is an overview of the results we have collected.</p>
<h2>Location:</h2>
		<div id="chartdiv" style="width: 100%; height: 400px;  float: left; clear: both;"></div>
		<h2>Sports:</h2>
		<div id="chartdiv_sports" style="width: 100%; height: 600px;  float: left; clear: both;" ></div>
		<h2>Survey Questions:</h2>
		<h3>Question 1: Do athletes and teams have the right to compete in an environment where all play by the agreed-upon rules for the sport?</h3>
		<div id="chartdiv_q1" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;  float: left; clear: both;" ></div>
		<h3>Question 1: Comments</h3>
</div>

<div class="cd-testimonials-wrapper cd-container one">
	<ul class="cd-testimonials one">
		<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The playing field should be as even as possible.  Doping should have bigger consequences.  It isnt fair and the punishment isnt long enough.  And the money earned at the time before being caught should be transferred to the true champ or taken away from the doper.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It is implied that we do compete on a level playing field...but then we continue to learn (after the fact) that this is rarely the case.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>This is a silly question.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Same rules should apply to all who agree to compete at NGB sanctioned competitions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>well sure i believe we 'have a right to this' however in literal terms, it isn't entirely possible...most rules are made by governing bodies. hopefully with input and feedback from athletes but i've seen from past experience even with the best of efforts, polls etc this info is not taken into account.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>As of the last IOC ruling on Russia it does not feel that way. We know doping was going on, and Sochi itself has yet to be acknowledged.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Its the most important right.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Absolutely, when people agree to play by the rules, we should all be held to those standards.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"Rights" is the wrong work to describe the institution.  There are rules, punishments, and probabilities of being caught cheating.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Everyone should follow the rules, but there should be an open and drug-free division.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The rules are set in advance. All participants agree to the rules by consenting to participate. Anyone intentionally violating the rules should be punished severely.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Why does an athlete who puts his time and hard work in have to compete against an "athlete" who cheats and gets the same reward.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Of course, in terms of rowing, if athletes dont all agree on the same rules, what is stopping a crew from putting a motor on their boat that would guide them to an easy win? If there are no rules, then it ruins the integrity of the sport...</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There should be no other option. That is the definition of fair.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Tough to tell, some countries don't have off season testing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Fairness---that is the spirit of competition---or it was----the leaders as they are called  of sport seem to think differently, with what has  taken place in the past decades.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>That is the definition of sport...</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>This seems self evident.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>This is a social contract that we enter into on the playground and when entering organized sport. Coaches, officials, team / league organizers and parents must promote and exemplify this position from an early age to elite competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes to this question is paramount in  encouraging youth and their parents to participate in sport at a high level!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Mike Gallagher used to tell a story about the Olympic trials in 1964 or there about where all the skiers were put on similar equipment, and wax info was available to all. Now I'm sure it was that simple, but that simple formula, and many other common sense methods that could be implemented would make it so sport could be on a much more fair and ethical footing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>organizer of the event can always set the rules, athlete does not have to participate if he does not agree with the rules</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Any other way is absurd.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Rule breaking is part of sport. There must be consequences though. These range from in game penalties to fines to suspensions and even bans. It would be naive to believe 100% rule adherence is possible.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>When high stakes are involved, whether money or prestige, cheating will always be a threat.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Are you serious? "Agreed-upon rules" should be a given.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>That's the spirit of competition and sport, fairness!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Not sure who would answer this question with a "no". Seems pretty obvious!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I wish you had done a better job of explaining what your beef is, other than "cheating is bad". What does getting medals by mail have to do with anything? What processes do you hope to implement or change?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Regardless of whether the sport is monitored before, during, after the event, an athlete should have the internal fortitude, moral compass, personal integrity, call it what you will, to do the right thing. To follow a rule - even when no one but you will ever know whether or not you followed that rule.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I have been to events where participants are told to use only support and feed stations provided by the organizers, but where several of my competitors have used private support such as a car with spare wheels, food and clothing that they have used during the race. while its clearly stated in the rule book as forbidden, these racers have not been dq-ed or punished for the infringements in any way.  it feels unfair to those of us who play by the rules and dont take outside help.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Ethics isn't about rules, it's how you judge your own actions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>With both the spirit & letter of the law. An athlete knows what the rules are, do not try and find a way to break the rules while  " still  following them "</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Keep it equal with what is allowed by the rules, break the agreed upon rules and DQed</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Athletic competition should reflect the abilities of the athletes themselves, and not their ability to artificially enhance them.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The clean and cleansing essence of sport lies in its total openness and lack of pretense. You are as good as the results show you are at any given moment. Deceit of any kind rots that essence and its noble history.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>To compete on a level playing field should be more than an athlete and team's right, it should be a given in every single sport at every single level of competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Noah Hoffman said it well: "Sport is defined by arbitrary rules. The race or competition is held to see who can perform best within the given guidelines." There is no point in having the competition if all competitors are not going to operate within the rules.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think this is one of the critical foundations of any sport and game even from the youngest age.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, they do, but you are naive to think that some of the current vocal voices were clean in their career, or that doping can ever be stopped. Certainly what the Russians have done is so outrageous that different relevant bodies had to respond, but there never has been clean Olympics, World Championships, World Cup, National Championships, or other events, even regional in nordic much less other sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"However, if organizations like WADA continue to be a bunch of pussys when it comes to cracking down on violations I do not see any reason that people will be more inclined to dope. 

Although I obviously never would go through with it the day I see myself cheated out of a win, recognition, or team nomination by a dirty athlete would be the day I would consider doping. When this circumstance arrives I don't completely blame the retaliating athlete, but the sport federation itself."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should have the right but currently it seems if those rights are being violated.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>That's a no brainer!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>All sports have rules - whether it is keeping your toes behind the line until the gun goes off, the type of flip turn you can do from backstroke to breaststroke, the kind of uniform you can wear, or the technological or physiological enhancements allowed in sport.  Anti-doping must be an element of these agreed upon rules.  Everyone swimming backstroke or running a race all follow those same set of rules - that's what makes each event, an event within that sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Fundamental right</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Clean drug free sports are essential to that goal of fair sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Indeed, it is the responsibility of the governing bodies to make certain that the athletes are clean and that the competition is fair.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chemical, Mechanical manipulation are both cheating</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Absolutely, as the whole idea of competition is fair play.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The right to compete in a fair play environment must be the cornerstone of any initiative stamping out cheating. Denying athletes or teams due to cheating by some is unfair to those who compete by the rules and provides empty victories to those who win where fair playing athletes are denied the right to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>UCI rules and Olympic rules seem to bend and flex by political winds.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It is also the responsibility of the athlete, coach and others involved to  play by the rules.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes.  Exceptions could be made where rules overlook extenuating circumstances of athletes that the rulemakers did not predict, but in general, all should play by the agreed upon rules.   Where exceptions are made, this should be very rare and ethics based and then the rules should be changed to reflect this so it is not an exception in the future.   An example might be when I was in high school a kid broke a ski during a big race and it would have been nice if he could have accepted a replacement ski, even though the rules said athletes had to finish on the same skis they started on.  That is the need for a rule change due to an event that the rules overlooked.  In general it is very important  that all athletes play by the agreed upon rules.</p></li>

			<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The playing field should be as even as possible.  Doping should have bigger consequences.  It isnt fair and the punishment isnt long enough.  And the money earned at the time before being caught should be transferred to the true champ or taken away from the doper.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It is implied that we do compete on a level playing field...but then we continue to learn (after the fact) that this is rarely the case.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>This is a silly question.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Same rules should apply to all who agree to compete at NGB sanctioned competitions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>well sure i believe we 'have a right to this' however in literal terms, it isn't entirely possible...most rules are made by governing bodies. hopefully with input and feedback from athletes but i've seen from past experience even with the best of efforts, polls etc this info is not taken into account.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>As of the last IOC ruling on Russia it does not feel that way. We know doping was going on, and Sochi itself has yet to be acknowledged.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Its the most important right.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Absolutely, when people agree to play by the rules, we should all be held to those standards.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"Rights" is the wrong work to describe the institution.  There are rules, punishments, and probabilities of being caught cheating.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Everyone should follow the rules, but there should be an open and drug-free division.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The rules are set in advance. All participants agree to the rules by consenting to participate. Anyone intentionally violating the rules should be punished severely.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Why does an athlete who puts his time and hard work in have to compete against an "athlete" who cheats and gets the same reward.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Of course, in terms of rowing, if athletes dont all agree on the same rules, what is stopping a crew from putting a motor on their boat that would guide them to an easy win? If there are no rules, then it ruins the integrity of the sport...</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There should be no other option. That is the definition of fair.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Tough to tell, some countries don't have off season testing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Fairness---that is the spirit of competition---or it was----the leaders as they are called  of sport seem to think differently, with what has  taken place in the past decades.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>That is the definition of sport...</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>This seems self evident.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>This is a social contract that we enter into on the playground and when entering organized sport. Coaches, officials, team / league organizers and parents must promote and exemplify this position from an early age to elite competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes to this question is paramount in  encouraging youth and their parents to participate in sport at a high level!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Mike Gallagher used to tell a story about the Olympic trials in 1964 or there about where all the skiers were put on similar equipment, and wax info was available to all. Now I'm sure it was that simple, but that simple formula, and many other common sense methods that could be implemented would make it so sport could be on a much more fair and ethical footing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>organizer of the event can always set the rules, athlete does not have to participate if he does not agree with the rules</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Any other way is absurd.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Rule breaking is part of sport. There must be consequences though. These range from in game penalties to fines to suspensions and even bans. It would be naive to believe 100% rule adherence is possible.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>When high stakes are involved, whether money or prestige, cheating will always be a threat.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Are you serious? "Agreed-upon rules" should be a given.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>That's the spirit of competition and sport, fairness!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Not sure who would answer this question with a "no". Seems pretty obvious!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I wish you had done a better job of explaining what your beef is, other than "cheating is bad". What does getting medals by mail have to do with anything? What processes do you hope to implement or change?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Regardless of whether the sport is monitored before, during, after the event, an athlete should have the internal fortitude, moral compass, personal integrity, call it what you will, to do the right thing. To follow a rule - even when no one but you will ever know whether or not you followed that rule.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I have been to events where participants are told to use only support and feed stations provided by the organizers, but where several of my competitors have used private support such as a car with spare wheels, food and clothing that they have used during the race. while its clearly stated in the rule book as forbidden, these racers have not been dq-ed or punished for the infringements in any way.  it feels unfair to those of us who play by the rules and dont take outside help.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Ethics isn't about rules, it's how you judge your own actions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>With both the spirit & letter of the law. An athlete knows what the rules are, do not try and find a way to break the rules while  " still  following them "</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Keep it equal with what is allowed by the rules, break the agreed upon rules and DQed</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Athletic competition should reflect the abilities of the athletes themselves, and not their ability to artificially enhance them.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The clean and cleansing essence of sport lies in its total openness and lack of pretense. You are as good as the results show you are at any given moment. Deceit of any kind rots that essence and its noble history.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>To compete on a level playing field should be more than an athlete and team's right, it should be a given in every single sport at every single level of competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Noah Hoffman said it well: "Sport is defined by arbitrary rules. The race or competition is held to see who can perform best within the given guidelines." There is no point in having the competition if all competitors are not going to operate within the rules.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think this is one of the critical foundations of any sport and game even from the youngest age.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, they do, but you are naive to think that some of the current vocal voices were clean in their career, or that doping can ever be stopped. Certainly what the Russians have done is so outrageous that different relevant bodies had to respond, but there never has been clean Olympics, World Championships, World Cup, National Championships, or other events, even regional in nordic much less other sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"However, if organizations like WADA continue to be a bunch of pussys when it comes to cracking down on violations I do not see any reason that people will be more inclined to dope. 

Although I obviously never would go through with it the day I see myself cheated out of a win, recognition, or team nomination by a dirty athlete would be the day I would consider doping. When this circumstance arrives I don't completely blame the retaliating athlete, but the sport federation itself."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should have the right but currently it seems if those rights are being violated.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>That's a no brainer!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>All sports have rules - whether it is keeping your toes behind the line until the gun goes off, the type of flip turn you can do from backstroke to breaststroke, the kind of uniform you can wear, or the technological or physiological enhancements allowed in sport.  Anti-doping must be an element of these agreed upon rules.  Everyone swimming backstroke or running a race all follow those same set of rules - that's what makes each event, an event within that sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Fundamental right</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Clean drug free sports are essential to that goal of fair sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Indeed, it is the responsibility of the governing bodies to make certain that the athletes are clean and that the competition is fair.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chemical, Mechanical manipulation are both cheating</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Absolutely, as the whole idea of competition is fair play.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The right to compete in a fair play environment must be the cornerstone of any initiative stamping out cheating. Denying athletes or teams due to cheating by some is unfair to those who compete by the rules and provides empty victories to those who win where fair playing athletes are denied the right to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>UCI rules and Olympic rules seem to bend and flex by political winds.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It is also the responsibility of the athlete, coach and others involved to  play by the rules.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes.  Exceptions could be made where rules overlook extenuating circumstances of athletes that the rulemakers did not predict, but in general, all should play by the agreed upon rules.   Where exceptions are made, this should be very rare and ethics based and then the rules should be changed to reflect this so it is not an exception in the future.   An example might be when I was in high school a kid broke a ski during a big race and it would have been nice if he could have accepted a replacement ski, even though the rules said athletes had to finish on the same skis they started on.  That is the need for a rule change due to an event that the rules overlooked.  In general it is very important  that all athletes play by the agreed upon rules.</p></li>

<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If rules aren't enforced, why are they there???</p></li>

I think that is not a very safe practice, but that is what is done, and athletes need to learn about that.  Those marathons are not FIS events.  However, I also think the local organizations, especially regional ones that are the main organizations in the sport for their regions (like NENSA) should follow the international rules of the sport as much as possible, and publicize very clearly to what extent they are doing so and what rules they are not following and why.</p></li>

	<h3>Question 3: Comments</h3>
</div>
<div class="cd-testimonials-wrapper cd-container three">
	<ul class="cd-testimonials three">
		<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctions should be much harsher</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Doping needs a hardline response, otherwise cheaters will continue to cheat even if it costs them a short term ban</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctions in some cases should be longer, and/or "life" sentences, in cases where use of certain drugs have been shown to have performance enhancement far longer than the sanctions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>high level cheats (expo, hgh, blood doping, testosterone, etc) should be banned for life.  It embarrassing how some of these federations are getting away with covering up or even supporting doping programs.   Sanctions need to be consistent among countries as well.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>No tolerance policy is the only way to show athletes that our governing bodies are serious about cleaning up the sport. When people keep getting second chances, it undermines the rules and makes people think they can get away with it and still have a future in sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abusers of the rules should be banned from competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>otherwise, what is the point of the rules in the first place?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If the abuser in question has clearly intended to seek an unfair advantage over his/her competitors, then they should absolutely be sanctioned.  If it can be proved that an honest mistake was made by the abuser, there should still be a penalty, but maybe not as harsh as for those who intended to cheat.  Overall the penalties need to be clear, severe, and strictly upheld in order to be effective.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, for chronic abusers that have significant evidence against them.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Excluded from competition and at the same time helped to improve their compliance with WADA and IOC!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>ABSOLUTELY. i guess i would say they should be sanctioned by the 'rules' however, i do believe there should be discretion among the enforcers too; meaning, if/when someone gets a doping sanction (6 mo or 2 yr) then again is found to be say tampering with a test or bribing a DCO? there should be a rule of sorts "2 strikes" as this is unacceptable behavior which implies consistent rule breaking, consistent lack of integrity for one's sport and lack of respect for all involved. i would like to see far more stringent bans with doping offenses but moreso MULTIPLE offenses.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abuse of rules in sport sacrifices the integrity of the sport. Some people get away with too much and the sports and athletes suffer from their actions and lack of repercussions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If you are caught doping, participating in doping, are helping others dope, you should face the harshest consequences that can be received. It is not fair for clean athletes to compete against an opponent that is enhanced. It is not fair that some of these athletes are being allowed to compete in Rio, and as it looks, letting doping athletes from Sochi get away with it.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Excused in circumstances of extreme violation</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>As well as all affiliated.  Trainers, coaches, NGBs should be held responsible for allowing consistent violations to occur.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abusers should not be allowed to compete. At all. Never again. Cheating is not a forgivable offense.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>When cheaters are caught more than once they have no regard for the rules, a second doping offense means they should be banned for life.  I also believe first time penalties should be more strict.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Once you have shown you skirt rules or systematically avoid testing, you should be gone.  It's not your right to compete, there are rules that have to be followed.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>We are, for the most part, adults. One offense Ina critical time can be disastrous in many ways.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I believe that abusers should face a penalty.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I believe that one positive test should erase their name and any accomplishment from existence even if before the date of the test.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Again, the "should" is bothersome.  What is the objective?  What would be the effect of a two tier sporting system, one with no doping restrictions and one with doping restrictions? .</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If you are going to have only a drug-free division, it should be a lifetime suspension on first offense. Also, every athlete should have to provide a bond guaranteeing their clean urine-blood on penalty of default. In the bond, there could also be provision made to forfeit any prize money, sponsor money, or even other assets.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I do my absolute best to compete clean. Cheating is cheating. Now if they are not caught, I refuse to be bitter about it because whether it is fair or not, I still have to compete against them and go for the win. But if you are caught you should not be allowed to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I believe 3 strikes and you're out to be a fair system</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abusers yes, one time mistakes no</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>What is the point of sanctions and rules if they are not followed. That said until the first offense is met with a lifetime ban, the risk will always be worth the reward when it comes to cheating for some.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I believe in one and done for intentional cheaters</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>By excused,do you mean lifetime ban because that is the only way to put an end to this cheating.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Two strike rule.  First offence of a doping case gets a sanction.  Second offense gets you banned from all sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>chronic abusers should not be allowed to compete</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Strict sanctions, even for first time offenders (assuming it was clearly intentional cheating). Also, all results after the test in question will be null.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There should be increasing levels of punishment for repeat offenders. Could be as simple as three strokes and you are out!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abusers should be kicked out for a long period of time. By that, I mean up to a 20 year sanction- this way, all cheats within a generation are eliminated.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It should not be chronic - one time warning two times banned</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Simple solution here to fix all sport that is broken now by all the cheating---life time suspensions for all levels of infractions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>By excused, does this mean a free pass?  Or eliminated from competition?  Chronic abusers should NOT be allowed to continue to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Fines and bans are the only way to clean up sport. Chronic abusers should have higher consequences than they currently do.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I spent my whole xc ski career racing against countries  that allowed and even encouraged their athletes to win at any cost. I knew, as many of us did at the time, that the playing field was not even. Still, I had the desire to win; to do my best with all that I had inside me; to compete and represent my country, my state, my family. On my own, with nothing but pure grit, pure strength, pure technique, pure attitude.....I did my best. I'm proud of my efforts and grateful for all the opportunities I was given to compete at the elite level in ski racing. I met wonderful people along the way and learned about Life in a unique fashion, lessons that have served me well over the years. I did not win any Olympic or World Cup Medals. I won in Life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If chronic, repeated users should be banned</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If chronic offenders aren't punished, what is the point of funding sports federations? Or for that matter, allow sport federations from collecting fees, since they could be construed as being frauds?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"My Solution:



Becky Scott (and and anyone else injured by cheating) should sue the Olympic Committee , the Russian Sports Federation and the doping athlete for $10 million dollars to compensate for  lost revenue.  The Committees were negligent in their duty to detect doping and provide fair competition. Without doping she would  have made millions in sponsorships, celebrity appearances, clothing and equipment endorsements, etc.



What will happen?  The doping athlete will be found guilty but have no money to compensate Becky. The Olympic Committee should concede they were incompetent and agree to pay Becky $10 million dollars. Russia may deny guilt but the Olympic Committee should say they will not be permitted to compete in the next games until they remit the $10 million to pass on to Becky plus the cost of legal fees.



Once this president it created, it can be duplicated by any athlete harmed by doping. Punitive damages can be added by the courts until the cost of doping and certainty of punishment becomes so great, the incentive to dope will end. Each country's story federation will become very diligent at testing their own athletes to prevent these fines."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctions should not be just for athletes.  Who supplied the illegal drugs?   Who adminstered them?   Coaches and doctors should not be exempt from sanctions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>One and done rule</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>First time offences should get lifetime bans.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If someone has been caught cheating repeatedly, they should be considered to have broken faith, they shouldn't be trusted automatically to compete clean in the future.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>No.  They should be called out.  If need be, not allowed to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>No question.... those that contravene the rules should be sanctioned ... just as one would be fined or sanctioned in breaking the rules  of  society</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Individuals, athletes, coaches, administrators, governing bodies, national programs, etcetera should all face sanctions that have real and deleterious affects on these entities, which would so degrade their ability to compete that cheating became an unthinkable route to take.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Both Athletes and coaches as well as trainers</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should be banned for life, no excuses.  Know the rules and play by the rules</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There should be a logical protocol that starts with sanctions and the ability to improve the record to work way back to competition, or to be banned from competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I understand the need for sanctions, because in the public's mind there's room for doubt, however far fetched. Fans don't want to see their heroes cheat, so they believe excuses like tainted meat or supplements, or mishandled samples. Is any of that possible? It's unlikely, but yes, it's technically possible. So that's why the sanctions exist - to hedge against the possibility it was all somehow accidental. If anyone is ever caught twice, there should be no doubt that they are forever banned from participation, not only in the sport in which they were caught, but in all other IOC and WADA administered sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Repeat offenders should be banned for life. Second infraction, gone!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Not only should cheaters be sanctioned but simply be banned forever of participating to any sports competition professional or even amateur.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"Be excused?" Why would you even ask such a question? How can ANY contest be played without rules? You can't be serious with this question.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>A single offense should be punished with a lifetime ban.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>A life ban in that sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Should not be limited to 'chronic abusers'. Enforce rules for all consistently, always.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctions, yes. But 2 strikes and you're out! I believe there are a very few athletes who fail tests for unwittingly using banned substances. They should get a second, but not a third chance.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I also think athletes and supporters should consider  different sorts of boycotts (e.g., not participating, not viewing events on tv, etc) so that organizations, such as the IOC get the message, as this will impact revenue.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think it depends on the severity of the abuse, and should be determined case-by-case. Obviously this could cause issues with consistency but I think overall would produce better results.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime bans for cheaters (and those who enable them:  coaches, medical people, officials, etc.).   This is not a complicated idea.  If a bank employee steals money from  the bank where they work, they don't get back their job at the bank after they get out of prison.   Why should cheaters in sport  be any different?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>These are the most leading questions since the political "polls" the republicans and democrats put out! Do you really think anybody will seriously say cheating is okay?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Kick them out!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There's a lot of grey area in here, so there is a need for sanctioning, excusing, or pardoning, depending on the nature, severity, and frequency of the abuse.  But I think we are past the point in most sports where we can ignore the fact that athletes (and/or their coaches and support teams)abusing the rules are okay to ignore.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>i think on repeat offences that the abusers need to be banned for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>A two year suspension from all competitions for a first offense and complete disbarment for a second offense.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If an athlete is caught doping for any serious substances, they should be banned for life from the sport. The effects of their actions give them an advantage for years to come and they are not consistently tested during their ban period.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>While certainly the athlete is to blame for putting these substances in his/her body there must be underlying pressure from somewhere, somebody for them to feel the need to perform to winning standards beyond what they know they are capable of. The crux of the problem is trying to figure out where this outside pressure is coming from. Is it merely the State's desire to show off to the world it's sports prowess, sponsor needs for headlines to justify the sponsorship expense or other. The sanctions should go beyond the athlete to these entities as well.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Everyone can change and should be given the opportunity..</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Mistakes are made and first time offenders should have a chance to defend their actions, but repeat offenders aren't learning that cheating is wrong if they are still allowed to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If the rules are agreed upon they need to be inforced , even if a whole team is DQ</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Ideally repeat offenders should be banned for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think abusers should be punished, and made to realize the consequences of their actions, but should not be made to leave the sport, in order to allow people to change and return.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime bans</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"If athletes were treated the same way for cheating on doping as they are treated for cheating on sponsorship we would have very different events.  Notice how sports , like golf and basketball, with strong organizations independent of the IOC have a much more difficult time getting their best athletes to  play in Olympics.



In the quest to be the absolute best one has to explore all the options and play as close to the cheating line as possible. If you don't go over once in a while you trying hard enough."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Banned from competition for a significant period of time.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>We need a framework of rules to govern sports, and any individuals or groups who break the rules should expect to be punished and to face the consequences of their actions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>more lifetime bans needed</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It depends on the level of competition.  Sanctions should be strongly enforced for professional, national team level, junior qualifiers and other premier circuits.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>lifetime bans.  end of discussion.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Athletes should receive warnings when a substance has been recently banned and they may not have known it was a banned substance (ex, ingredients in cold medications).  If an athlete tests positive for a known banned substance they should be excused for life.  If an athlete receives 2 or more warnings for lesser known substances they should be excused for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"Athletes may make a mistake through inattention or lack of complete information about substances they ingest, but chronic abuse signals dependency on artificial support, which means the athlete or coach suffers from a neurotic lack of basic courage to accept what human beings are. 



I have an adage: If you do it once, it's history. If you do it again, it's culture.  A culture which depends upon alien substances creates aliens, not of a human world."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Within competition an athlete is removed from that game or event if they break rules repeatedly (ie-receiving a red card in soccer).  It would only be logical that if they continually abuse The Code that they would be removed from the sport for a determined amount of time.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime ban!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Abusers should not be allowed to participate, bans should be longer.  As a former athlete and now coach and physiotherapist I am a true believer in the positive aspects of sport and healthy competition.  I cannot fathom how frustrating it must be for athletes to compete against cheaters.   It affects the results, funding and the spirit of what competition should be about.  It is disheartening to coach at the club level and have the youngest athletes talk about who is doping.  Athletes should be looked up to as dedicated hardworking role models</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Zero tolerance is the only way to deter cheaters/dopers.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It's not that simple. there are different levels of abuse, wether it's chronic or not. You can't just say that everyone who is a chronic abuser of the rules of sport shall be excused. Also explain "Chronic" how many times, days, weeks months, years. this is an extremely broad question.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Every time cheating is excused it takes away from the legitimacy of sport as a whole and undermines all the hard work of those who are following the rules.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, but only when we can determine that everyone else is legit. At the present time and in the past, sanctioning only gets rid of certain individuals and is hypocritical  when a high percentage of remaining  athletes are also dirty.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Maybe there should be a process for first time offense punishment..... then never again if future violations.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime ban for a list of "majors", like EPO and steroids, and for first time caught - but continue w/ 6 mo - 2 year ban for drugs that can be a legitimate mistake, as could be the case with any athlete taking the wrong cold medicine.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It appears that a zero tolerance approach is required.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Athletes who are caught in a doping violation should get a life time ban from competing in sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If you are found to be a doper there should be no mercy show.  Let's create a sport climate where winning by the rules is the ONLY way to win.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, it is unfortunate that clean athletes get penalized for actions out of their control - that's exactly what has happened for every athlete who has ever received their medal outside of the Olympic stadium, who received their medal in the mail though.  They were cheated as well.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Zero tolerance for intentional cheats</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Achieving "success" through the use of outlawed performance enhancing substances is not simply unethical, immoral cheating.  It is theft!  Theft of other athlete's achievement of goals and success.  Theft of the joy and happiness other competitors and the general community find in sport.  In some cases, and in higher levels of sport, cheating clearly can result in theft of the significant financial reward that can accompany athletic success:  both podium purses and potential future financial benefit in the form of contracts, sponsorship, employment, and etc.  It is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE for confirmed cheaters to be allowed to continue competing.  Further, it is absurd that any nation convincingly shown to be institutionally involved in doping in sport to receive anything but the most punitive of sanctions!  Totally unacceptable!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It should be the responsibility of the athlete to prove that 'accidental use' really is accidental. No more gentle pats on the hand. Throw them out. If anyone can prove that using a banned substance was really accidental, fine, then give them a second shot. If anything EVER happens again, throw them out!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>For sure.  They should be sanctioned.  However, we seem to have the IOC neglecting their responsibility.  When the IOC has a report presented to them regarding CHRONIC abuse they are obliged to act.  In my opinion - why have the IOC if they are gutless.  Olympics has lost the original focus - youth of the world coming together for fair competition.  Intended to make the world a better place.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>For life</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abusers should be banned for life. It's too easy for cheaters/dopers to return at a high level after serving bans. Look at Justin Gattlin, he is a prime example of a repeat offender that should be banned for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If they are excused then there will be less infractions</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The only way to clean up sports  is to make some hard decisions and let the abusers sit on the sidelines until the message of competing clean gets heard,</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctioned, then excused when clean up has been recorded and adjudicated for a time period dependant upon the infraction.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should not have the opportunity to become chronic abusers</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>For life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The 2nd time of an offense, they should be permanently barred from competing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think doping is dangerous to dopers and unfair to non-dopers.  People who chronically dope on purpose should not be allowed to compete, so that people who do not dope get fair athletic opportunities.  However, I also realize on a local level it is not possible to adequately test, and there are some performance enhancers and training enhancers that are not banned (ex ibuprofen used more than recommended on the package), so it's a flawed system.   I think it is important to work to remove performance enhancing substances from sports.   I think at the same time it is important not to be overzealous about punishing people who have something in their system due to a reason that does not have to do with doping on purpose.   I do not know what other cheating goes on in xc skiing besides doping.   I really do not see the point of cheating.  Why not just retire and do something else to make money?  It is easy to make more money than in cross country skiing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>As an individual  or team but not as a nation.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should be expelled from the sport if they are chronic abusers of the rules.</p></li>

<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Fines and bans are the only way to clean up sport. Chronic abusers should have higher consequences than they currently do.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I spent my whole xc ski career racing against countries  that allowed and even encouraged their athletes to win at any cost. I knew, as many of us did at the time, that the playing field was not even. Still, I had the desire to win; to do my best with all that I had inside me; to compete and represent my country, my state, my family. On my own, with nothing but pure grit, pure strength, pure technique, pure attitude.....I did my best. I'm proud of my efforts and grateful for all the opportunities I was given to compete at the elite level in ski racing. I met wonderful people along the way and learned about Life in a unique fashion, lessons that have served me well over the years. I did not win any Olympic or World Cup Medals. I won in Life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If chronic, repeated users should be banned</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If chronic offenders aren't punished, what is the point of funding sports federations? Or for that matter, allow sport federations from collecting fees, since they could be construed as being frauds?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"My Solution:



Becky Scott (and and anyone else injured by cheating) should sue the Olympic Committee , the Russian Sports Federation and the doping athlete for $10 million dollars to compensate for  lost revenue.  The Committees were negligent in their duty to detect doping and provide fair competition. Without doping she would  have made millions in sponsorships, celebrity appearances, clothing and equipment endorsements, etc.



What will happen?  The doping athlete will be found guilty but have no money to compensate Becky. The Olympic Committee should concede they were incompetent and agree to pay Becky $10 million dollars. Russia may deny guilt but the Olympic Committee should say they will not be permitted to compete in the next games until they remit the $10 million to pass on to Becky plus the cost of legal fees.



Once this president it created, it can be duplicated by any athlete harmed by doping. Punitive damages can be added by the courts until the cost of doping and certainty of punishment becomes so great, the incentive to dope will end. Each country's story federation will become very diligent at testing their own athletes to prevent these fines."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctions should not be just for athletes.  Who supplied the illegal drugs?   Who adminstered them?   Coaches and doctors should not be exempt from sanctions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>One and done rule</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>First time offences should get lifetime bans.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If someone has been caught cheating repeatedly, they should be considered to have broken faith, they shouldn't be trusted automatically to compete clean in the future.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>No.  They should be called out.  If need be, not allowed to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>No question.... those that contravene the rules should be sanctioned ... just as one would be fined or sanctioned in breaking the rules  of  society</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Individuals, athletes, coaches, administrators, governing bodies, national programs, etcetera should all face sanctions that have real and deleterious affects on these entities, which would so degrade their ability to compete that cheating became an unthinkable route to take.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Both Athletes and coaches as well as trainers</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should be banned for life, no excuses.  Know the rules and play by the rules</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There should be a logical protocol that starts with sanctions and the ability to improve the record to work way back to competition, or to be banned from competition.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I understand the need for sanctions, because in the public's mind there's room for doubt, however far fetched. Fans don't want to see their heroes cheat, so they believe excuses like tainted meat or supplements, or mishandled samples. Is any of that possible? It's unlikely, but yes, it's technically possible. So that's why the sanctions exist - to hedge against the possibility it was all somehow accidental. If anyone is ever caught twice, there should be no doubt that they are forever banned from participation, not only in the sport in which they were caught, but in all other IOC and WADA administered sports.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Repeat offenders should be banned for life. Second infraction, gone!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Not only should cheaters be sanctioned but simply be banned forever of participating to any sports competition professional or even amateur.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"Be excused?" Why would you even ask such a question? How can ANY contest be played without rules? You can't be serious with this question.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>A single offense should be punished with a lifetime ban.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>A life ban in that sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Should not be limited to 'chronic abusers'. Enforce rules for all consistently, always.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctions, yes. But 2 strikes and you're out! I believe there are a very few athletes who fail tests for unwittingly using banned substances. They should get a second, but not a third chance.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I also think athletes and supporters should consider  different sorts of boycotts (e.g., not participating, not viewing events on tv, etc) so that organizations, such as the IOC get the message, as this will impact revenue.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think it depends on the severity of the abuse, and should be determined case-by-case. Obviously this could cause issues with consistency but I think overall would produce better results.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime bans for cheaters (and those who enable them:  coaches, medical people, officials, etc.).   This is not a complicated idea.  If a bank employee steals money from  the bank where they work, they don't get back their job at the bank after they get out of prison.   Why should cheaters in sport  be any different?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>These are the most leading questions since the political "polls" the republicans and democrats put out! Do you really think anybody will seriously say cheating is okay?</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Kick them out!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>There's a lot of grey area in here, so there is a need for sanctioning, excusing, or pardoning, depending on the nature, severity, and frequency of the abuse.  But I think we are past the point in most sports where we can ignore the fact that athletes (and/or their coaches and support teams)abusing the rules are okay to ignore.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>i think on repeat offences that the abusers need to be banned for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>A two year suspension from all competitions for a first offense and complete disbarment for a second offense.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If an athlete is caught doping for any serious substances, they should be banned for life from the sport. The effects of their actions give them an advantage for years to come and they are not consistently tested during their ban period.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>While certainly the athlete is to blame for putting these substances in his/her body there must be underlying pressure from somewhere, somebody for them to feel the need to perform to winning standards beyond what they know they are capable of. The crux of the problem is trying to figure out where this outside pressure is coming from. Is it merely the State's desire to show off to the world it's sports prowess, sponsor needs for headlines to justify the sponsorship expense or other. The sanctions should go beyond the athlete to these entities as well.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Everyone can change and should be given the opportunity..</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Mistakes are made and first time offenders should have a chance to defend their actions, but repeat offenders aren't learning that cheating is wrong if they are still allowed to compete.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If the rules are agreed upon they need to be inforced , even if a whole team is DQ</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Ideally repeat offenders should be banned for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think abusers should be punished, and made to realize the consequences of their actions, but should not be made to leave the sport, in order to allow people to change and return.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime bans</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"If athletes were treated the same way for cheating on doping as they are treated for cheating on sponsorship we would have very different events.  Notice how sports , like golf and basketball, with strong organizations independent of the IOC have a much more difficult time getting their best athletes to  play in Olympics.



In the quest to be the absolute best one has to explore all the options and play as close to the cheating line as possible. If you don't go over once in a while you trying hard enough."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Banned from competition for a significant period of time.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>We need a framework of rules to govern sports, and any individuals or groups who break the rules should expect to be punished and to face the consequences of their actions.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>more lifetime bans needed</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It depends on the level of competition.  Sanctions should be strongly enforced for professional, national team level, junior qualifiers and other premier circuits.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>lifetime bans.  end of discussion.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Athletes should receive warnings when a substance has been recently banned and they may not have known it was a banned substance (ex, ingredients in cold medications).  If an athlete tests positive for a known banned substance they should be excused for life.  If an athlete receives 2 or more warnings for lesser known substances they should be excused for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>"Athletes may make a mistake through inattention or lack of complete information about substances they ingest, but chronic abuse signals dependency on artificial support, which means the athlete or coach suffers from a neurotic lack of basic courage to accept what human beings are. 



I have an adage: If you do it once, it's history. If you do it again, it's culture.  A culture which depends upon alien substances creates aliens, not of a human world."</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Within competition an athlete is removed from that game or event if they break rules repeatedly (ie-receiving a red card in soccer).  It would only be logical that if they continually abuse The Code that they would be removed from the sport for a determined amount of time.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime ban!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Abusers should not be allowed to participate, bans should be longer.  As a former athlete and now coach and physiotherapist I am a true believer in the positive aspects of sport and healthy competition.  I cannot fathom how frustrating it must be for athletes to compete against cheaters.   It affects the results, funding and the spirit of what competition should be about.  It is disheartening to coach at the club level and have the youngest athletes talk about who is doping.  Athletes should be looked up to as dedicated hardworking role models</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Zero tolerance is the only way to deter cheaters/dopers.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It's not that simple. there are different levels of abuse, wether it's chronic or not. You can't just say that everyone who is a chronic abuser of the rules of sport shall be excused. Also explain "Chronic" how many times, days, weeks months, years. this is an extremely broad question.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Every time cheating is excused it takes away from the legitimacy of sport as a whole and undermines all the hard work of those who are following the rules.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, but only when we can determine that everyone else is legit. At the present time and in the past, sanctioning only gets rid of certain individuals and is hypocritical  when a high percentage of remaining  athletes are also dirty.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Maybe there should be a process for first time offense punishment..... then never again if future violations.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Lifetime ban for a list of "majors", like EPO and steroids, and for first time caught - but continue w/ 6 mo - 2 year ban for drugs that can be a legitimate mistake, as could be the case with any athlete taking the wrong cold medicine.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It appears that a zero tolerance approach is required.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Athletes who are caught in a doping violation should get a life time ban from competing in sport.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If you are found to be a doper there should be no mercy show.  Let's create a sport climate where winning by the rules is the ONLY way to win.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Yes, it is unfortunate that clean athletes get penalized for actions out of their control - that's exactly what has happened for every athlete who has ever received their medal outside of the Olympic stadium, who received their medal in the mail though.  They were cheated as well.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Zero tolerance for intentional cheats</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Achieving "success" through the use of outlawed performance enhancing substances is not simply unethical, immoral cheating.  It is theft!  Theft of other athlete's achievement of goals and success.  Theft of the joy and happiness other competitors and the general community find in sport.  In some cases, and in higher levels of sport, cheating clearly can result in theft of the significant financial reward that can accompany athletic success:  both podium purses and potential future financial benefit in the form of contracts, sponsorship, employment, and etc.  It is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE for confirmed cheaters to be allowed to continue competing.  Further, it is absurd that any nation convincingly shown to be institutionally involved in doping in sport to receive anything but the most punitive of sanctions!  Totally unacceptable!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>It should be the responsibility of the athlete to prove that 'accidental use' really is accidental. No more gentle pats on the hand. Throw them out. If anyone can prove that using a banned substance was really accidental, fine, then give them a second shot. If anything EVER happens again, throw them out!</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>For sure.  They should be sanctioned.  However, we seem to have the IOC neglecting their responsibility.  When the IOC has a report presented to them regarding CHRONIC abuse they are obliged to act.  In my opinion - why have the IOC if they are gutless.  Olympics has lost the original focus - youth of the world coming together for fair competition.  Intended to make the world a better place.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>For life</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Chronic abusers should be banned for life. It's too easy for cheaters/dopers to return at a high level after serving bans. Look at Justin Gattlin, he is a prime example of a repeat offender that should be banned for life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>If they are excused then there will be less infractions</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The only way to clean up sports  is to make some hard decisions and let the abusers sit on the sidelines until the message of competing clean gets heard,</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>Sanctioned, then excused when clean up has been recorded and adjudicated for a time period dependant upon the infraction.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should not have the opportunity to become chronic abusers</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>For life.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>The 2nd time of an offense, they should be permanently barred from competing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>I think doping is dangerous to dopers and unfair to non-dopers.  People who chronically dope on purpose should not be allowed to compete, so that people who do not dope get fair athletic opportunities.  However, I also realize on a local level it is not possible to adequately test, and there are some performance enhancers and training enhancers that are not banned (ex ibuprofen used more than recommended on the package), so it's a flawed system.   I think it is important to work to remove performance enhancing substances from sports.   I think at the same time it is important not to be overzealous about punishing people who have something in their system due to a reason that does not have to do with doping on purpose.   I do not know what other cheating goes on in xc skiing besides doping.   I really do not see the point of cheating.  Why not just retire and do something else to make money?  It is easy to make more money than in cross country skiing.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>As an individual  or team but not as a nation.</p></li>
<li class="cd-testimonials-item"><p>They should be expelled from the sport if they are chronic abusers of the rules.</p></li>

<p>This survey was initiated by cross country ski coaches and circulated largely in that community. Our objective was to give all people a chance to give some feedback on the current situation in sport. While a lot of the recent publicity has been around Olympic level sport, it is also important for those at the grass roots, provincial, state, and national level to be heard.</p>
